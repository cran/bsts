### Functions for obtaining diagnostics (mainly different flavors of
### residuals) from bsts objects.
### ----------------------------------------------------------------------
residuals.bsts <- function(object,
                           burn = SuggestBurn(.1, object),
                           mean.only = FALSE,
                           ...) {
  ## Args:
  ##   object:  An object of class 'bsts'.
  ##   burn:  The number of iterations to discard as burn-in.
  ##   mean.only: Logical.  If TRUE then the mean residual for each
  ##     time period is returned.  If FALSE then the full posterior
  ##     distribution is returned.
  ##   ...: Not used.  This argument is here to comply with the
  ##     generic 'residuals' function.
  ##
  ## Returns:
  ##   If mean.only is TRUE then this function returns a vector of
  ##   residuals with the same "time stamp" as the original series.
  ##   If mean.only is FALSE then the posterior distribution of the
  ##   residuals is returned instead, as a matrix of draws.  Each row
  ##   of the matrix is an MCMC draw, and each column is a time point.
  ##   The colnames of the returned matrix will be the timestamps of
  ##   the original series, as text.

bsts.prediction.errors <- function(bsts.object,
                                   cutpoints = NULL,
                                   burn = SuggestBurn(.1, bsts.object),
                                   standardize = FALSE) {
  ## Returns the posterior distribution of the one-step-ahead prediction errors
  ## from the bsts.object.  The errors are computing using the Kalman filter,
  ## and are of two types.
  ##
  ## Purely in-sample errors are computed as a by-product of the Kalman filter
  ## as a result of fitting the model.  These are stored in the bsts.object
  ## assuming the save.prediction.errors argument is TRUE, which is the default.
  ## The in-sample errors are 'in-sample' in the sense that the parameter values
  ## used to run the Kalman filter are drawn from their posterior distribution
  ## given complete data.  Conditional on the parameters in that MCMC iteration,
  ## each 'error' is the difference between the observed y[t] and its
  ## expectation given data to t-1.
  ##
  ## Purely out-of-sample errors can be computed by specifying the 'cutpoints'
  ## argument.  If cutpoints are supplied then a separate MCMC is run using just
  ## data up to the cutpoint.  The Kalman filter is then run on the remaining
  ## data, again finding the difference between y[t] and its expectation given
  ## data to t-1, but conditional on parameters estimated using data up to the
  ## cutpoint.
  ##
  ## Args:
  ##   bsts.object:  An object created by a call to 'bsts'.
  ##   cutpoints: An increasing sequence of integers between 1 and the number of
  ##     time points in the training data for 'bsts.object', or NULL.  If NULL
  ##     then the in-sample one-step prediction errors from the bsts object will
  ##     be extracted and returned.  Otherwise the model will be re-fit with a
  ##     separate MCMC run for each entry in 'cutpoints'.  Data up to each
  ##     cutpoint will be included in the fit, and one-step prediction errors
  ##     for data after the cutpoint will be computed.
  ##   burn:  The number of MCMC iterations to discard as burn-in.
  ##   standardize: Logical.  If TRUE then the prediction errors are divided by
  ##     the square root of the one-step-ahead forecast variance.  If FALSE the
  ##     raw errors are returned.
  ##
  ## Returns:
  ##   A list, with entries giving the distribution of one-step prediction
  ##   errors corresponding to individual cutpoints.  Each list entry is a
  ##   matrix, with rows corresponding to MCMC draws, and columns corresponding
  ##   to time points in the data for bsts.object.  If the in-sample prediction
  ##   errors were stored in the original model fit, they will be present in
  ##   list.
