  ## This function is part of the implementation for bsts.  It puts
  ## the data and model options into the format expected by the
  ## underlying C++ code.
  ##
  ## Args:
  ##   family: String naming the model family for the observation
  ##     equation.
  ##   response: The vector (or in some cases two-column matrix) of
  ##     responses to be modeled.
  ##   predictors: The matrix of predictor variables.  This can be
  ##     NULL if the model has no regression component.
  ##   model.options:  Options returned by BstsOptions().
  ##   timestamp.info: An object of class TimestampInfo describing the time
  ##     stamps associated with the responses.
  ##
  ## Returns:  A list with two elements:  data.list and model.options.
